📚 Reading Notes

    Some sections are intentionally fragmented to reflect the protagonist’s shifting perception.

    World-building draws on real-world esoteric systems but is highly fictionalized.

    Character arcs may not fully resolve in this draft.

    Comments or reactions on tone, clarity, or pacing are especially helpful.
